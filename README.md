# Hi there üëã my name is Dallen, Pyrah.

I've always had a passion for technology and want to help technology advance to improve aspects in everyones lives. I am a very persistent and driven fullstack developer who's main love is frontend work. I think about ways that will improve the future which results in my desire for learning how things work and finding ways to improve upon it. After trying a variety of different avenues out I decided to try software development and it has been the perfect fit, it allows me to be creative while still doing something I love.
