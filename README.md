# Hi there üëã my name is Dallen, Pyrah. 

I have over a year of experience working in the tech industry. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at In Time Tec, where I am contracted out to Truckstop. I am working closely with a cross-functional team of six, developing and maintaining their payment products that are helping people get paid faster and securely! I'm deeply passionate about creating loved and trusted systems that help people eliminate or ease problems in their lives. 

Previously, I went to school at CodeWorks with a focus on Full-Stack Software Development. I learned how to write clean, secure, and efficient applications that also improved my knowledge of many different languages. We wrote applications using a variety of different frameworks and languages from starting out with a loosely typed language like Javascript to writing applications using the strongly typed language of C# in combination with Vue and Node.js. 

Before going to school to get certified, I was going to school at the College of Western Idaho with the intent to get an Architectural degree. After contemplating what it was I really wanted, I came across a job listing for a Software Architect. This really started my deep dive into software engineering and where my path to becoming a Software Engineer started. 

If you catch me outside of work, I'm a nature lover and enjoy biking, swimming, camping or even just hanging out in a park. I have dreams of learning how to surf which go along with my love for the ocean! 

I also like meeting new people over a cup of yerba mate ‚Äî natures way of bringing people together. Feel free to reach out at dallenpyrah@gmail.com or DM on Instagram @imdallen.
